# Arduino Car

This is a project that I worked on in my last year in high school. The project involved creating a miniature car that functions autonomously as well as move in the direction of light (this was done using four photo-resistors on each side of the car). 

# Objective

The objective of the project was to integrate various parts into our car to not only function but to function well enough to compete with other students' projects.

# What was learned

Before senior year in high school, I didn't really know what Arduino was, nor how it functioned. This class gave me more insight on how to program different parts in the Arduino set as well as tinker with all the materials and parts that were available to me.
